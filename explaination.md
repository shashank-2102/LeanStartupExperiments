  - `update_config()`: Updates application settings
- Error Handling:
  - `execute_with_retry()`: Attempts database operations multiple times if they fail

**Connections:** Acts as the central hub for all database operations, used by nearly every other file.

## 6. auth.py

**Purpose:** Handles user authentication (login, registration, logout).

**Key Functions:**
- `show_auth_page()`: Displays login and registration options
- `show_login_form()`: Shows login form and verifies credentials
- `show_registration_form()`: Shows registration form and creates new accounts
- `logout()`: Ends user sessions
- `load_user_chat_history()`: Loads previous conversations after login

**Connections:** Works with `db_manager.py` to verify user credentials and is used by `app.py` to control access to the system.

## 7. chat.py

**Purpose:** Manages the display and formatting of chat messages.

**Key Functions:**
- `display_chat_messages()`: Shows the conversation history in the interface
- `format_message_content()`: Properly formats different message types (text, code blocks)
- `clear_chat_history()`: Removes previous conversation history

**Connections:** Used by `app.py` to render chat messages and interacts with `db_manager.py` when clearing history.

## 8. agent.py

**Purpose:** Handles communication with the OpenAI API to get AI responses.

**Key Functions:**
- `get_openai_client()`: Sets up the connection to OpenAI using the API key
- `get_agent_response()`: Sends user messages to OpenAI and returns AI responses

**Key Variables:**
- System and user messages that are sent to the AI service
- Error handling for API issues

**Connections:** Works with `db_manager.py` to get the API key and is used by `app.py` to generate agent responses.

## 9. rag_system.py

**Purpose:** Implements an intelligent system to recommend the most appropriate agent for user queries.

**Key Components:**
- `RAGSystem` class: Core recommendation engine
  - `update_agent_knowledge()`: Learns about available agents
  - `get_best_agent_for_query()`: Matches user questions to the best agent
  - `get_agent_recommendations()`: Suggests multiple relevant agents

**Helper Functions:**
- `get_best_agent()`: Simplified access to agent recommendations
- `get_agent_recommendations()`: Gets multiple agent suggestions
- `update_agent_knowledge()`: Refreshes the recommendation system

**Connections:** Uses `db_manager.py` to get agent information and is used by `app.py` and `admin.py` for agent recommendations.

## 10. admin.py

**Purpose:** Provides an administration dashboard for system management.

**Key Functions:**
- `show_admin_page()`: Main admin interface with tabbed sections
- `manage_agents()`: Interface for creating and editing AI agents
- `manage_users()`: Interface for managing user accounts
- `system_config()`: Interface for system settings (like API keys)

## 11. app.py

**Purpose:** The main application file that ties everything together and creates the user interface.

**Key Functions:**
- `main()`: Application entry point
- `render_sidebar()`: Creates the navigation sidebar

**Connections:** Central file that imports and coordinates all other modules:
- Uses `models.py` for database setup
- Uses `db_manager.py` for data access
- Uses `auth.py` for user authentication
- Uses `chat.py` for message display
- Uses `agent.py` for AI responses
- Uses `admin.py` for administration features
- Uses `rag_system.py` for agent recommendations

## System Flow Overview

1. **Initialization:**
   - `app.py` starts the application
   - `models.py` establishes database connection
   - Default data is created if needed

2. **User Authentication:**
   - `auth.py` handles login/registration
   - `db_manager.py` verifies credentials
   - User chat history is loaded if available

3. **Chat Interaction:**
   - User selects an agent in sidebar
   - User enters a message
   - `app.py` processes the message
   - `agent.py` gets AI response via OpenAI
   - `chat.py` displays the conversation
   - `db_manager.py` saves the conversation

4. **Administration:**
   - Admin users can access the admin dashboard
   - `admin.py` provides interfaces for system management
   - Changes are saved via `db_manager.py`
   - `rag_system.py` updates recommendations when agents change

## Key Technical Features

1. **Immediate Message Display:**
   - User messages appear instantly without waiting for AI response
   - Two-phase approach with session state tracking

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Retry mechanisms for database operations
   - Graceful error messages for users
   - Debug mode for administrators

3. **Security:**
   - Password-based authentication system
   - Role-based access control (admin vs. regular users)
   - Environment variable management for sensitive data

4. **AI Integration:**
   - OpenAI API communication
   - Multiple agent personalities
   - Intelligent agent recommendations based on query content

This multi-agent chatbot system creates a web interface where users can create accounts, chat with different AI personalities, and administrators can manage the system - all with persistent storage of conversations and settings.
